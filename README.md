# eFarm: Streamlining Agriculture Operations

eFarm is a comprehensive Django-Angular project designed to enhance farming operations through digital solutions. The platform focuses on precision agriculture, providing tailored apps for different sectors - Dairy, Poultry, and soon Swine.

## Introduction

eFarm aims to revolutionize farming by offering an integrated digital platform. With dedicated apps for Dairy, Poultry, and upcoming Swine sector, the project facilitates efficient data management and operation optimization.

## Getting Started

Please note that the frontend development is currently paused until the backend is completed for at least the Dairy and Poultry sectors.

### Backend (Django)

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/peter-evance/demo-efarm.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd efarm`.
3. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Linux/macOS: `source env/bin/activate`
   - On Windows: `.\env\Scripts\activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.
7. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.

### Frontend (Angular)

Frontend development is temporarily paused until the backend for Dairy and Poultry sectors is completed.

## Usage

Once the Django development server is running, access the eFarm app at `http://localhost:8000/`. You can explore the various apps and models to manage and view data relevant to your farm operations.
